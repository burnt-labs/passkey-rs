/// Unfortunately `serde_json::to_vec` does NOT properly serialize [`CollectedClientData`](crate::internals::CollectedClientData).
/// You MUST use the custom serializer below in order to serialize it back into `clientDataJSON`

///
/// The serialization of the [`CollectedClientData`](crate::internals::CollectedClientData)
/// is a subset of the algorithm for JSON-serializing
/// to bytes. I.e. it produces a valid JSON encoding of the `CollectedClientData` but also provides
/// additional structure that may be exploited by verifiers to avoid integrating a full JSON parser.
/// While verifiers are recommended to perform standard JSON parsing, they may use the more
/// limited algorithm below in contexts where a full JSON parser is too large. This verification
/// algorithm requires only base64url encoding, appending of bytestrings (which could be
/// implemented by writing into a fixed template), and three conditional checks (assuming that
/// inputs are known not to need escaping).
///
/// The serialization algorithm works by appending successive byte strings to an, initially empty,
/// partial result until the complete result is obtained.
///
/// 1. Let result be an empty byte string.
/// 2. Append 0x7b2274797065223a ({"type":) to result.
/// 3. Append CCDToString(type) to result.
/// 4. Append 0x2c226368616c6c656e6765223a (,"challenge":) to result.
/// 5. Append CCDToString(challenge) to result.
/// 6. Append 0x2c226f726967696e223a (,"origin":) to result.
/// 7. Append CCDToString(origin) to result.
/// 8. Append 0x2c2263726f73734f726967696e223a (,"crossOrigin":) to result.
/// 9. If crossOrigin is not present, or is false:
///     1. Append 0x66616c7365 (false) to result.
/// 10. Otherwise:
///     1. Append 0x74727565 (true) to result.
/// 11. Create a temporary copy of the CollectedClientData and remove the fields
///     type, challenge, origin, and crossOrigin (if present).
/// 12. If no fields remain in the temporary copy then:
///     1. Append 0x7d (}) to result.
/// 13. Otherwise:
///     1. Invoke serialize JSON to bytes on the temporary copy to produce a byte string remainder.
///         (see below for how this is done)
///     2. Append 0x2c (,) to result.
///     3. Remove the leading byte from remainder.
